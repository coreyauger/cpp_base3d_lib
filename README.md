Base3d lib C++
==============

## Overview
This is a small and simple base 3d library written in C++.  You would be crazy to write your own 3d library in todays worldâ€¦ However there are still a number of applications for using a compact 3d library to learn from or implement application specific problems.

This code was written a while back but used in a number of 3d applications during my time in University.  I have decided to share it in the hopes that someone could find it as useful as I once did.
