Base3d lib C++
==============

## Overview
This is a small and simple base 3d library written in C++.  You would be crazy to write your own 3d library in todays worldâ€¦ However there are still a number of applications for using a compact 3d library to learn from or implement application specific problems.

This code was written a while back but used in a number of 3d applications during my time in University.  I have decided to share it in the hopes that someone could find it as useful as I once did.

## Example projects

### Collision Detection Project
This project I designed a large "ball" course that I let serve as a demonstration of the physics I wrote.  This was a super fun project and ended up working very well.

### Water Simulation
This was a really fun project to work on. The main idea for the movement of the water came from one of my favorite sites on the net: The [good-looking textured light-sourced bouncy fun smart and stretchy page](http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/graphics/x_water.htm)

### Radiosity

Dividing each face of our scene into light-map texel regions, we are going to perform a gathering type of radiosity solution. First by using GL to render the scene from the perspective of a texel into a hemi-cubed texture map, we solve the visibility problem.
